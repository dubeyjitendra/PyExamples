    "A Bernoulli trial is one of the simplest experiments you can conduct. It’s an experiment where you can have one of two possible outcomes. For example, “Yes” and “No” or “Heads” and “Tails.” A few examples:\n",

    "\n",
    "Bernoulli trials are usually phrased in terms of success and failure. Success doesn’t mean success in the usual way—it just refers to an outcome you want to keep track of. For example, you might want to find out how many boys are born each day, so you call a boy birth a “success” and a girl birth a “failure.” In the dice rolling example, a double six die roll would be your “success” and everything else rolled would be considered a “failure.”\n",

    "A binomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times.

Roll twenty times and you have a binomial distribution of (n=20, p=1/6). SUCCESS would be “roll a one” and FAILURE would be “roll anything else.” If the outcome in question was the probability of the die landing on an even number, the binomial distribution would then become (n=20, p=1/2). That’s because your probability of throwing an even number is one half.\n",

For example, if a new drug is introduced to cure a disease, it either cures the disease (it’s successful) or it doesn’t cure the disease (it’s a failure). If you purchase a lottery ticket, you’re either going to win money, or you aren’t. Basically, anything you can think of that can only be a success or a failure can be represented by a binomial distribution."
