For any given Z-score we can compute the area under the curve to the left of that Z-score. The table in the frame below shows the probabilities for the standard normal distribution. Examine the table and note that a \"Z\" score of 0.0 lists a probability of 0.50 or 50%, and a \"Z\" score of 1, meaning one standard deviation above the mean, lists a probability of 0.8413 or 84%. That is because one standard deviation above and below the mean encompasses about 68% of the area, so one standard deviation above the mean represents half of that of 34%.
