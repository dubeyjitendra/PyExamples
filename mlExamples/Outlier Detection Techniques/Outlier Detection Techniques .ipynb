    "# What is an Outlier?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier is a commonly used terminology by analysts and data scientists as it needs close attention else it can result in wildly wrong estimations. Simply speaking, Outlier is an observation that appears far away and diverges from an overall pattern in a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take an example, we do customer profiling and find out that the average annual income of customers is $0.8 million. But, there are two customers having annual income of $4 and $4.2 million. These two customers annual income is much higher than rest of the population. These two observations will be seen as Outliers\n",

    "\n",
    "What are the types of Outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier can be of two types: Univariate and Multivariate. Above, we have discussed the example of univariate outlier. These outliers can be found when we look at distribution of a single variable. Multi-variate outliers are outliers in an n-dimensional space. In order to find them, you have to look at distributions in multi-dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand this with an example. Let us say we are understanding the relationship between height and weight. Below, we have univariate and bivariate distribution for Height, Weight. Take a look at the box plot. We do not have any outlier (above and below 1.5*IQR, most common method). Now look at the scatter plot. Here, we have two values below and one above the average in a specific segment of weight and height.\n",

    " What causes Outliers?\n",
    " \n",
    " Whenever we come across outliers, the ideal way to tackle them is to find out the reason of having these outliers. The method to deal with them would then depend on the reason of their occurrence. Causes of outliers can be classified in two broad categories:\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "1.\tArtificial (Error) / Non-natural\n",
    "2.\tNatural.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand various types of outliers in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tData Entry Errors:- Human errors such as errors caused during data collection, recording, or entry can cause outliers in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Annual income of a customer is $100,000. Accidentally,  the  data entry  operator  puts an additional zero in the figure. Now the income becomes  $1,000,000 which is 10 times higher. Evidently, this will be the outlier value when compared with rest of the population.\n",
    "•\tMeasurement Error: It is the most common source of outliers. This is caused when the measurement instrument used turns out to be faulty. For example: There are 10 weighing machines. 9 of them are correct, 1 is faulty. Weight measured by people on the faulty machine will be higher / lower than the rest of people in the group. The weights measured on faulty machine can lead to outliers.\n",
    "•\tExperimental Error: Another cause of outliers is experimental error. For example: In a 100m sprint of 7 runners, one runner missed out on concentrating on the ‘Go’ call which caused him to start late. Hence, this caused the runner’s run time to be more than other runners. His total run time can be an outlier.\n",
    "•\tIntentional Outlier: This is commonly found in self-reported measures that involves sensitive data. For example: Teens would typically under report the amount of alcohol that they consume. Only a fraction of them would report actual value. Here actual values might look like outliers because rest of the teens are under reporting the consumption.\n",
    "•\tData Processing Error: Whenever we perform data mining, we extract data from multiple sources. It is possible that some manipulation or extraction errors may lead to outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "•\tSampling error: For instance, we have to measure the height of athletes. By mistake, we include a few basketball players in the sample. This inclusion is likely to cause outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "•\tNatural Outlier: When an outlier is not artificial (due to error), it is a natural outlier. For instance: In my last assignment with one of the renowned insurance company, I noticed that the performance of top 50 financial advisors was far higher than rest of the population. Surprisingly, it was not due to any error. Hence, whenever we perform any data mining activity with advisors, we used to treat this segment separately.\n",
    " \n",
    "What is the impact of Outliers on a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can drastically change the results of the data analysis and statistical modeling. There are numerous unfavourable impacts of outliers in the data set:\n",
    "•\tIt increases the error variance and reduces the power of statistical tests\n",
    "•\tIf the outliers are non-randomly distributed, they can decrease normality\n",
    "•\tThey can bias or influence estimates that may be of substantive interest\n",
    "•\tThey can also impact the basic assumption of Regression, ANOVA and other statistical model assumptions.\n",
    "To understand the impact deeply, let’s take an example to check what happens to a data set with and without outliers in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "![title](outlier_img/out4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, data set with outliers has significantly different mean and standard deviation. In the first scenario, we will say that average is 5.45. But with the outlier, average soars to 30. This would change the estimate completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How to detect Outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly used method to detect outliers is visualization. We use various visualization methods, like Box-plot, Histogram, Scatter Plot (above, we have used box plot and scatter plot for visualization). Some analysts also various thumb rules to detect outliers. Some of them are:\n",
    "•\tAny value, which is beyond the range of -1.5 x IQR to 1.5 x IQR\n",
    "•\tUse capping methods. Any value which out of range of 5th and 95th percentile can be considered as outlier\n",
    "•\tData points, three or more standard deviation away from mean are considered outlier\n",
    "•\tOutlier detection is merely a special case of the examination of data for influential data points and it also depends on the business understanding\n",
    "•\tBivariate and multivariate outliers are typically measured using either an index of influence or leverage, or distance. Popular indices such as Mahalanobis’ distance and Cook’s D are frequently used to detect outliers.\n",
    "•\tIn SAS, we can use PROC Univariate, PROC SGPLOT. To identify outliers and influential observation, we also look at statistical measure like STUDENT, COOKD, RSTUDENT and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How to remove Outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the ways to deal with outliers are similar to the methods of missing values like deleting observations, transforming them, binning them, treat them as a separate group, imputing values and other statistical methods. Here, we will discuss the common techniques used to deal with outliers:\n",
    "Deleting observations: We delete outlier values if it is due to data entry error, data processing error or outlier observations are very small in numbers. We can also use trimming at both ends to remove outliers.\n",
    "Transforming and binning values: Transforming variables can also eliminate outliers. Natural log of a value reduces the variation caused by extreme values. Binning is also a form of variable transformation. Decision Tree algorithm allows to deal with outliers well due to binning of variable. We can also use the process of assigning weights to different observations.\n",
