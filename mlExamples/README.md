 <h1>Machine-Learning</h1>
 
<h3> Part -1 --- Preprocessing </h3>
 
 Preprocessing is very impotant aspects in machine learning so we will also cover preprocessing, beloow are the following points:
 
1.	Variable Identification

2.	Univariate Analysis

3.	Bi-variate Analysis

4- Multi- variate Analysis

5.	Missing values treatment

6.	Outlier treatment

7.	Variable transformation

8.	Variable creation

9. Feature Selection

10. Feature Engginering

11. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)


 
 <h3> Part -2 --- Algorithms </h3>
 
 
 1- Linear Regression
 
 2- Multi-Variate Regression
 
 3- Decision Tree
 
 4- Random Forests
 
 5- Logistic Regression:
 
 6- K-NN 
 
 7- Naive Bayes Algorithms
 
 8- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
